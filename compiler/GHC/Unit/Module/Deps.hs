Note [Transitive Information in Dependencies]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is important to be careful what information we put in 'Dependencies' because
ultimately it ends up serialised in an interface file. Interface files must always
be kept up-to-date with the state of the world, so if `Dependencies` needs to be updated
then the module had to be recompiled just to update `Dependencies`.

Before #16885, the dependencies used to contain the transitive closure of all
home modules. Therefore, if you added an import somewhere low down in the home package
it would recompile nearly every module in your project, just to update this information.

Now, we are a bit more careful about what we store and
explicitly store transitive information only if it is really needed.

# Direct Information

* dep_direct_mods - Directly imported home package modules
* dep_direct_pkgs - Directly imported packages
* dep_plgins      - Directly used plugins

# Transitive Information

Some features of the compiler require transitive information about what is currently
being compiled, so that is explicitly stored separately in the form they need.

* dep_trusted_pkgs - Only used for the -fpackage-trust feature
* dep_boot_mods  - Only used to populate eps_is_boot in -c mode
* dep_orphs        - Modules with orphan instances
* dep_finsts       - Modules with type family instances

Important note: If you add some transitive information to the interface file then
you need to make sure recompilation is triggered when it could be out of date.
The correct way to do this is to include the transitive information in the export
hash of the module. The export hash is computed in `GHC.Iface.Recomp.addFingerprints`.

{-
Note [Structure of mod_boot_deps]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In `-c` mode we always need to know whether to load the normal or boot version of
an interface file, and this can't be determined from just looking at the direct imports.

Consider modules with dependencies:

```
A -(S)-> B
A -> C -> B -(S)-> B
```

Say when compiling module `A` that we need to load the interface for `B`, do we load
`B.hi` or `B.hi-boot`? Well, `A` does directly {-# SOURCE #-} import B, so you might think
that we would load the `B.hi-boot` file, however this is wrong because `C` imports
`B` normally. Therefore in the interface file for `C` we still need to record that
there is a hs-boot file for `B` below it but that we now want `B.hi` rather than
`B.hi-boot`. When `C` is imported, the fact that it needs `B.hi` clobbers the `{- SOURCE -}`
import for `B`.

Therefore in mod_boot_deps we store the names of any modules which have hs-boot files,
and whether we want to import the .hi or .hi-boot version of the interface file.

If you get this wrong, then GHC fails to compile, so there is a test but you might
not make it that far if you get this wrong!

Question: does this happen even across packages?
No: if I need to load the interface for module X from package P I always look for p:X.hi.
